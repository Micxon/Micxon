ðŸŒ± I'm a Computer Engineering student at TecnolÃ³gico de Costa Rica. I'm an enthusiastic person who can work in a team and have a fluent and eloquent conversation in both Spanish and English. As for the personal part, I am passionate about music, videogames and sports, being part of a garage band and a brassband and practicing cycling and soccer. In the professional field, I am eager to learn new skills, technologies and methodologies. I would like to be able to do the internship in the company and be allowed to grow professionally and personally. 

I have interest in learning Cybersecurity, Software Design, Project Management, Object Oriented Programming.
